 - dynamic memory allocation 
    //--"new" operator--//
    - using the "new" operator, we can dynamically allocate memory and return the adress of the newly allocated
        memory, or 0 if it can't reserve the request space.
    - ex: 
        char* ptr;
        ptr = new char[ how_much ];
    - anytime you use the "new" operator, make sure that the allocation was successful 
        ie, the pointer != nullptr
        
    //--"delete" operator--//
    - the "delete" operator frees up memory dynamically allocated memory.
    - ex:
        delete [] ptr;
    - the programmer must remeber to free up dynamically allocated 
        memory before reassigning the pointer. Or else youll get a memory leak.
